# RecycleBuddy: Recycling Awareness App
Members: Jasmine Lao, Galit Bolotin, Vedant Sawal, Bhavdeep Randhawa

The goal of our software engineering project is to design and create a mobile application that raises awareness about recycling by educating about proper recycling techniques and identifying which types of materials can be recycled. This app will be a smart recycling assistant where users can learn how to dispose of their waste with features such as:

- Using image recognition, identifying whether the given item is recyclable or not. The user can take a picture of the item and the app will guide the user which bin it goes in.
- Scanning barcodes or plastic recycling codes (triangle symbol) through image recognition
- Tracking user’s recycling stats in a recycling log to determine their environmental impact 
- Gamifying users’ recycling habits to engage users (ie. virtual pet or plant)
- Having a reward or point system for a certain amount of recycled items
- Challenging friends through leaderboards and community challenges 
- Learning through an information hub to search which specific items and materials are recyclable and what they become after going through the whole process.
